                <!-- Introductory message -->
                <p class="about">My name is Clarabelle Gatewood (Nincorp100), I'm a Game Design <br>
                    and Development major, and am also learning various coding languages in my <br> 
                    free time. I love various different forms of art, such as music, movies, and <br> 
                    of course video games. I myself sing and play guitar, along with a few other instruments. <br>
                    Going into game development, I have a few studios that inspire me, such as the <br>
                    writing and design teams from Remedy Entertainment (Max Payne, Alan Wake, Quantum <br> 
                    Break, Control), or the art and visuals from Ska Studios (The Dishwasher: Vampire <br>
                    Smile, Charlie Murder, Salt and Sanctuary), and the world building, writing, and <br>
                    design from CD Projekt Red (Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077). I hope to eventually include/introduce <br>
                    more of my projects here as time goes on, so thank you for stopping by!
