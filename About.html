                <!-- Introductory message -->
                <p class="about">My name is Clarabelle Gatewood (Nincorp100), I'm a Game Design and Development major, and am also learning various coding languages in my free time. 
                    I love various different forms of art, such as music, movies, and of course video games. I myself sing and play guitar, along with a few other instruments. 
                    Going into game development, I have a few studios that inspire me, such as the writing and design teams from Remedy Entertainment (Max Payne, Alan Wake, 
                    Quantum Break, Control), or the art and visuals from Ska Studios (The Dishwasher: Vampire Smile, Charlie Murder, Salt and Sanctuary), and the world 
                    building, writing, and design from CD Projekt Red (Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077). I hope to eventually include/introduce more of my projects here as time 
                    goes on, so thank you for stopping by!
