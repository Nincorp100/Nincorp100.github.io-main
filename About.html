                <!-- Introductory message -->
                <p class="about">My name is Clarabelle Gatewood (Nincorp100), I'm currently studying Game Design and Development, and am also learning various coding languages in my 
                    free time. I love various different forms of art, such as music, movies, and of course video games. I myself sing and play guitar, along with a few 
                    other instruments. Going into game development, I have a few studios that inspire me, such as the writing and design teams from Remedy Entertainment 
                    (Max Payne, Alan Wake, Quantum Break, Control), or the art and visuals from Ska Studios (The Dishwasher: Vampire Smile, Charlie Murder, Salt and 
                    Sanctuary), and the world building, writing, and design from CD Projekt Red (Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077). I hope to eventually include/introduce more 
                    of my projects here as time goes on, so thank you for stopping by!
