    <p class="game-info"> <span> Claragatchi! </span> This is a demo for a virtual pet game made within Scratch, as of now, it only includes 3 stats to maintain, and only the "Care" 
        button has an accompanying animation, while "Food" and "Fun" both only have sounds. The green circle in the corner will hopefully eventually lead 
        to a small minigame which will add 10 points to each stat.</p>
